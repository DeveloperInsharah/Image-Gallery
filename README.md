<h2>That is my <b>IMAGE GALLERY PROJECT</b></h2>
<p>That is a task of our internship with <b>Code Alpha</b></p>

This is a responsive Image Gallery project developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap**. The gallery showcases images in an elegant layout, providing a smooth user experience with features like responsive design and interactive image previews.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The gallery adapts to various screen sizes using Bootstrap's grid system.
- **Interactive Previews**: Clicking on an image opens it in a larger view.
- **Hover Effects**: CSS animations for a polished user interface.
- **Custom Styling**: Additional styles added using custom CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the gallery.
- **CSS**: For custom styling and hover effects.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive features like image previews.
- **Bootstrap**: For a responsive and mobile-first design.

## Setup and Installation

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the gallery.

## Usage

1. Add your images to the `images/` folder.
2. Update the `index.html` file to include your images in the gallery:

```html
<div class="gallery">
  <img src="images/image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <img src="images/image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
  <img src="images/image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
</div>
```

3. Customize the gallery by editing the `styles.css` and `script.js` files.
